Hi there, I'm Shahrzad (Sherry) Sheikhi 👋
🌌 Astrophysicist | 💻 Data Scientist | 🚀 Frontier Researcher
I am an astrophysicist and professional data scientist dedicated to decoding the high-energy universe. My work bridges the gap between complex multi-wavelength observations and scalable computational modeling. From determining the relativistic properties of black holes to architecting machine learning pipelines for transient detection, I build the tools that turn raw data into physical truth.

🔍 What I’m Working On
High-Energy Transients: Investigating the mass and spin of black holes in GRBs (notably GRB 220101A) and modeling expectations for FRBs in binary systems.

X-Ray Binaries: Utilizing photometric and SED analysis to identify and characterize Ultra-Compact X-ray Binaries (UCXBs).

Computational Simulations: Implementing large-scale stellar evolution models using the MESA platform.

Data Science in Industry: Currently architecting high-performance Python solutions and ML models at CodeCraft Innovations.

🛠 Technical Toolkit
Languages: Python (Professional), Java, C++, LaTeX

Data Science: Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Statistical Inference, Big Data Analytics

Astrophysics Engines: MESA (Stellar Simulation), HEASARC, Swift/Fermi Data Analysis, GTBurst

💃 Beyond the Research (Human Side)
I believe that the same discipline and creativity required for science drive my life outside the lab.

Creative Expression: I am a passionate dancer and the founder of a boutique business creating galactic-inspired fashion and accessories—bringing the beauty of the cosmos into wearable art.

Teamwork & Strategy: You can often find me on the soccer field, where I apply the same competitive spirit and teamwork that I bring to international scientific collaborations.

Resilience: I am a "frontier woman" in astrophysics, driven by a relentless persistence that saw me through a life-threatening health battle while maintaining a trajectory of absolute professional excellence.
