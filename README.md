# Shahrzad (Sherry) Sheikhi 👋
### 🌌 Astrophysicist | 💻 Data Scientist | 🚀 Frontier Researcher

[cite_start]I am an astrophysicist and professional data scientist dedicated to decoding the high-energy universe[cite: 7]. [cite_start]My work bridges the gap between complex multi-wavelength observations and scalable computational modeling[cite: 8]. [cite_start]From determining the relativistic properties of black holes to architecting machine learning pipelines, I build the tools that turn raw data into physical truth[cite: 8, 53].

### 🔍 Research & Impact
* [cite_start]**High-Energy Astrophysics:** Determining the mass and spin of the black hole inside **GRB 220101A** using Fermi/LAT analysis.
* [cite_start]**Binary Systems:** Investigating expectations for **Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)** in black hole-neutron star binary systems[cite: 58, 61].
* [cite_start]**X-Ray Binaries:** Conducted photometric and SED analysis to identify **1RXS J180408.9-342058** as an Ultra-Compact X-ray Binary (UCXB)[cite: 54, 55].
* [cite_start]**Stellar Modeling:** Experienced in using the **MESA** platform for simulating stellar evolution[cite: 7, 50].

### 🛠 Technical Expertise
* [cite_start]**Programming:** Python (Professional), ML, Java, and LaTeX [cite: 44-48, 93].
* [cite_start]**Data Tools:** Fermi, Swift, HEASARC, GTBurst, TOPCAT, and GAIA [cite: 34-43].
* [cite_start]**Industry:** Currently applying my analytical skills as a **Data Scientist** at CodeCraft Innovations[cite: 21].

### 💃 The Frontier Woman (Life & Hobbies)
[cite_start]I believe that the same discipline and creativity required for science drive my life outside the lab[cite: 10]:
* [cite_start]**Creative Expression & Fashion:** I am the founder of a business selling **handmade galactic clothing** and accessories—bringing the beauty of the cosmos into wearable art[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Sports & Energy:** I have been an active amateur astronomer and night sky guide for over a decade[cite: 83], and I enjoy **soccer** and **dancing** as a way to stay energized and creative.
* [cite_start]**Resilience:** Having successfully defeated a brain tumor during my studies [cite: 12, 13][cite_start], I am driven by the dream of being a **frontier woman in astrophysics** and becoming an idol for girls worldwide to fight for their dreams.
