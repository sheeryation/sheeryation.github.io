### 🌌 Astrophysicist | 💻 Data Scientist | 🚀 Frontier Researcher

I am an astrophysicist and professional data scientist dedicated to decoding the high-energy universe. Currently based in Yerevan, Armenia, I work at CodeCraft Innovations while continuing my research collaborations with IPM and Moscow University.

My journey is defined by resilience. After successfully defeating a brain tumor during my studies, I committed myself to becoming an idol for girls worldwide to fight for their dreams.
