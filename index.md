### 🌌 Astrophysicist | 💻 Data Scientist | 🚀 Frontier Researcher

[cite_start]I am an astrophysicist and professional data scientist dedicated to decoding the high-energy universe[cite: 7, 8]. [cite_start]Currently based in Yerevan, Armenia, I work at CodeCraft Innovations while continuing my research collaborations with IPM Iran and Moscow University[cite: 21, 22].

My journey is defined by resilience. [cite_start]After defeating a brain tumor during my studies, I committed myself to becoming an idol for girls worldwide to fight for their dreams[cite: 12, 13]. [cite_start]I have traveled the world to visit observatories and experience different cultures, always keeping my eyes on the stars[cite: 14, 15].
