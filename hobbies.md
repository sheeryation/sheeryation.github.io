# 🎨 Beyond the Stars

### 👗 Galactic Fashion
I believe in having "a little bit of galaxy in everything I own"[cite: 10]. [cite_start]I founded a business selling **handmade galactic clothing and accessories** to share the beauty of the cosmos through fashion.


### 🔭 Astronomy Education & Guiding
I have over a decade of experience as an **amateur astronomer and night sky guide** (2015-2025)[cite: 83]. [cite_start]I enjoy teaching astronomy to all ages, from kindergarten kids to university students.

### ⚽ Exploration & Energy
I have lived in different cities and countries since I was 18 to experience diverse cultures. I also enjoy **soccer** and **dancing** to stay active and creative.
